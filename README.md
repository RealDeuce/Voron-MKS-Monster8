Monster8 for Voron v2.4 350 (350x350x430)

This is the config and any other files I end up needing for my install
of a Monster8 in my Voron v2.4.

So far, I don't have the board in my hands, so this is untested based on
their github project here: https://github.com/makerbase-mks/MKS-Monster8

Once I decide how to mount it (likely across the rails in front of the fans),
I'll put the STL files for the mount in here too.

I'll also likely do a "generic" config like the example ones in the Voron repository.
