# Monster8 for Voron v2.4

This is the config and any other files I end up needing for my install
of a Monster8 in my Voron v2.4.  So far, I don't have the board in my
hands, so this is untested based on their github project here:
https://github.com/makerbase-mks/MKS-Monster8

[Monster8-Klipper.cfg](./Monster8-Klipper.cfg) is a generic Klipper config that contains instructions
for standard build sizes.
[Monster8-350x350x430.cfg](./Monster8-350x350x430.cfg) is for my build.

Once I decide how to mount it (likely across the rails in front of the fans),
I'll put the STL files for the mount in here too.
