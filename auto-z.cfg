probe_nozzle_x: 231.0
probe_nozzle_y: 357.0
#   The X and Y coordinates (in mm) for clicking the nozzle on the
#   Z endstop.
probe_switch_x: 226.0
probe_switch_y: 337.5
#   The X and Y coordinates (in mm) for clicking the probe's switch
#   on the Z endstop.
#probe_bed_x: default from relative_reference_index of bed_mesh
#probe_bed_y: default from relative_reference_index of bed_mesh
#   The X and Y coordinates (in mm) for probing on the print surface
#   (e.g. the center point) These coordinates will be adapted by the
#   probe's X and Y offsets. The default is the relative_reference_index
#   of the configured bed_mesh. It will raise an error if there is no
#   probe_bed site and no bed_mesh with a relative_reference_index
#   configured.
#switch_offset: 0.42 # Standard value, too low
#switch_offset: 0.32 # First guess, too high
#switch_offset: 0.35 # Just a tiny bit of elephants foot
#switch_offset: 0.36 # But this one has some sausage areas... but I didn't soak soaking made it worse
#switch_offset: 0.35 # I can feel the edges, and Three Spiral Christmas Balls detached.
#switch_offset: 0.34 # First layer miced at 0.29mm also, it seems I forgot that lower this raises the nozzle.
#switch_offset: 0.40 # A bit of fading here...
#switch_offset: 0.39 # First layer stringy, go back to a bit of fading...
#switch_offset: 0.40 # Some elephants foot, clear oversquish
#switch_offset: 0.39 # Fading in a few areas, appears to have marked the PEI a bit
#switch_offset: 0.38 # Fading and slightly marginal, could be the filament though.
#switch_offset: 0.28 # Skirt was only 0.14mm thick!
#switch_offset: 0.14 # Brim was 0.225 thick...
switch_offset: 0.17
#
# This is good for the V6 hotend, but no damn good for the Dragon...
#switch_offset: 0.37 # With SB/CW2, *WAY* too low... complete squish, no lines.
#switch_offset: 0.32 # Still way too low... no lines, clear gouging
#switch_offset: 0.28 # We're in the right ballpark now, but still a bit low...
#switch_offset: 0.27 # And still too low...
#switch_offset: 0.25
#   The trigger point offset of the used mag-probe switch.
#   This needs to be fined out manually. More on this later
#   in this section..
max_deviation: 1.0
#   The maximum allowed deviation of the calculated offset.
#   If the offset exceeds this value, it will stop!
#   The default is 1.0 mm.
#samples: default from "probe:samples" section
#   The number of times to probe each point. The probed z-values
#   will be averaged. The default is from the probe's configuration.
#samples_tolerance: default from "probe:samples_tolerance" section
#   The maximum Z distance (in mm) that a sample may differ from other
#   samples. The default is from the probe's configuration.
#samples_tolerance_retries: default from "probe:samples_tolerance_retries" section
#   The number of times to retry if a sample is found that exceeds
#   samples_tolerance. The default is from the probe's configuration.
#samples_result: default from "probe:samples_result" section
#   The calculation method when sampling more than once - either
#   "median" or "average". The default is from the probe's configuration.
clearance: 10.0
#   The distance in mm to move up before moving to the next
#   position. The default is two times the z_offset from the probe's
#   configuration.
#position_min: 0.0
#   Minimum valid distance (in mm) used for probing move. The
#   default is from the Z rail configuration.
speed: 100.0
#   The moving speed in X and Y. The default is 50 mm/s.
#lift_speed: default from "probe:lift_speed" section
#   Speed (in mm/s) of the Z axis when lifting the probe between
#   samples and clearance moves. The default is from the probe's
#   configuration.
#probing_speed: default from "stepper_z:homing_speed" section.
#   The fast probing speed (in mm/s) used, when probing_first_fast
#   is activated. The default is from the Z rail configuration.
#probing_second_speed: default from "stepper_z:second_homing_speed" section.
#   The slower speed (in mm/s) for probing the recorded samples.
#   The default is second_homing_speed of the Z rail configuration.
#probing_retract_dist: default from "stepper_z:homing_retract_dist" section.
#   Distance to backoff (in mm) before probing the next sample.
#   The default is homing_retract_dist from the Z rail configuration.
probing_first_fast: true
#   If true, the first probing is done faster by the probing speed.
#   This is to get faster down and the result is not recorded as a
#   probing sample. The default is false.
start_gcode: Dock_Probe_Unlock
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute prior to each calibration command.
#   See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. This can be used to
#   attach the probe.
before_switch_gcode: Attach_Probe
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute prior to each probing on the
#   mag-probe. See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. This can be
#   used to attach the probe after probing on the nozzle and before probing
#   on the mag-probe.
end_gcode: Dock_Probe
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute after each calibration command.
#   See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. This can be used to
#   detach the probe afterwards.
